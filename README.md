## RFC: A construction for allowing SLP to be validated in Script

This repo contains specifications for enabling SLP in Script using a combination of validation oracles, multisig, and covenants, that are up for review and comment. It also contains WIP but functional implementations of these ideas. However, please keep in mind this is early stage and shouldn't yet be used in serious projects.
